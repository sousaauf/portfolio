                    This multimedia exhibition project focused on creating an immersive experience using a combination of digital installations and interactive elements. I collaborated with various artists to design and execute a space that combined video, sound, and interactive technology.

                <p>
                    My role included curating visual content, designing interactive user interfaces, and ensuring a seamless integration of different multimedia elements to engage the audience effectively. The goal was to evoke emotional connections and challenge perceptions through the fusion of technology and art.
