                <p>
                    For this project, I assisted a professional chef in transitioning to an artisan knife sharpening business by creating a complete brand identity from scratch. I designed a unique, visually compelling logo that reflects the craftsmanship of the trade, developed an intuitive and functional website, and implemented a cost-effective marketing strategy tailored to a limited budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I oversaw the production of printed materials, including business cards, logo stamps, and QR codes, ensuring brand consistency across all formats. I designed the brandâ€™s logo, created the website, and managed the marketing strategy within a limited budget. Additionally, I handled print orders for the logo and business materials.
