                    In collaboration with Vogue, this project focused on developing a sustainable shower gel bottle and eco-friendly packaging for women. My role involved creating the product's label, designing the packaging, and ensuring sustainability remained a key focus throughout the design process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From concept to execution, the project prioritized the use of eco-conscious materials, balancing aesthetics with environmental responsibility. This initiative aligns with Vogueâ€™s vision for a sustainable future in the beauty industry, emphasizing both functionality and style in its packaging.
