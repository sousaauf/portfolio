                <p>
                    This video mapping project involved creating large-scale projections on architectural surfaces, transforming buildings into dynamic canvases of light and motion. I worked with a team to design custom animations that were mapped onto the building's geometry.

                <p>
                    My contributions included animating visual content, handling the technical aspects of projection mapping, and ensuring the projections were synchronized with the music and other sensory elements to create a cohesive narrative. The result was a captivating, immersive experience for the audience.
